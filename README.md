# Rush_Life 
Name : Rush Life

How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?

    We are going to create a web application fitting into people’s daily life, which can help people get to know themselves better and provides a more efficient way to workout. 

How will this project make life easier?

    We want to make a useful application to help people keep up instead of paying for a fitness coach. This project will help people know how to keep diet on track, for example, what to eat, how long you should spend on workout per day, what exercise fit you better during workout. 

Who is the target audience? Who will use your product?

    Our target user will be the people who are new to workout, workout lover, and also people who want to lose their weight and stay on the diet.

the scope of your project?
Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.

    The main feature of our project is to help users plan themselves and keep track of them. We want to add more individual features, like giving advice on getting new sports gears, supplies and clothes, collecting credits from purchasing  And more important, we offer an online forum for people to exchange information there, for example, a professional exerciser giving out advice, and new exerciser looking for a coach. 

What are some sample stories/scenarios? 

    Sample scenario: A guy who are new to workout wants to know his current status of body and how to workout efficiently to look stronger. He first signs up to our application, after logging in, we will ask him to type in his weight and height. We calculate his BMI, and ask him how long the period he prefers, and give back the plan that fits him best, including foods and exercises. Every day he needs to check on our application if he does keep on track, if not, then he will leave a day blank. Once one period is completed, we will estimate his current status (if he is always telling us the truth :/) and give him a report about the change in this period, and the plan for the next one.
